Fishing Charter Prediction
Overview
This Python script implements a neural network model to predict whether a boat used for fishing is a charter boat or not based on the Catch Rate and Annual Income. The code uses the scikit-learn library for machine learning tasks and pandas for data manipulation.

Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
Usage
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/fishing-charter-prediction.git
cd fishing-charter-prediction
Set the working directory:
Replace the path in the script with the correct path to your Lab12 folder:

python
Copy code
# Replace this path with the correct path to your Lab12 folder
os.chdir("C:/Users/ual-laptop/Desktop/MIS545/Lab12")
Run the script:
bash
Copy code
python fishing_charter_prediction.py
Results
The script will display the dataset, its structure, and summary statistics. It will also visualize the neural network model and output predictions along with a confusion matrix and predictive accuracy.
