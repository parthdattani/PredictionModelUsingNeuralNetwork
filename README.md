# Fishing Charter Prediction

## Overview

This Python script implements a neural network model to predict whether a boat used for fishing is a charter boat or not based on the Catch Rate and Annual Income. The code uses the scikit-learn library for machine learning tasks and pandas for data manipulation.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib

## Usage

### Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/parthdattani/PredictionModelUsingNeuralNetwork.git
cd PredictionModelUsingNeuralNetwork


### Set the working directory:

Replace the path in the script with the correct path to your Lab12 folder:

```bash
# Replace this path with the correct path to your Lab12 folder
os.chdir("C:/Users/ual-laptop/Desktop/MIS545/Lab12")

### Run the script:

```bash
python fishing_charter_prediction.py

## Results

The script will display the dataset, its structure, and summary statistics. It will also visualize the neural network model and output predictionsalong with a confusion matrix and predictive accuracy.
